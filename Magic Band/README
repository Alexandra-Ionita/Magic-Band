                              Magic Tape

In this project, I designed and implemented a "Magic Tape" structure using a doubly linked list to 
manage characters and a pointer ("finger") to track the current position on the tape. I created
structures for a doubly linked list (the tape), a singly linked list for a command queue, and a
stack for managing undo/redo operations. Each structure includes functions for creation, insertion,
and memory management.

To handle UPDATE commands, I used a queue to store commands until execution. Core functions include:

MOVE_LEFT/RIGHT: Shifts the finger left or right, adjusting the tape if necessary.
MOVE_LEFT_CHAR/RIGHT_CHAR: Moves to the nearest cell with a specified character or adds a placeholder 
if not found.
WRITE, INSERT_LEFT/RIGHT: Writes a character on the tape or inserts it to the left or right of the current 
cell.
I implemented QUERY functions directly to display tape contents (SHOW) or the current character 
(SHOW_CURRENT). For UNDO/REDO, I used stacks to revert or reapply moves, pushing and popping pointers 
to maintain tape state.

The EXECUTE function extracts commands from the queue for execution. Commands are read from a file, 
processed sequentially, and outputted to a designated file, demonstrating efficient handling of operations 
on dynamic data structures with undo/redo capabilities.
